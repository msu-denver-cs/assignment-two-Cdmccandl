Assignment 2:
added validations to each model. assumed that length for each should be less than 2
and value presence should be true.

added search bars to each view by creating a search function in each controller
and calling this seach function in the view index for each model.
 
began to experiment with rails built in testing features and was able to get a decent test run with no failures and errors. Some references I used were https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQvB0QWe5Bs&t= and https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html. I also recieved a lot of help from Warren Ramos for different test cases.

What I learned:
How rails built in testing features work. I thought it was interesting and useful that rails allows you to directly validate in the model as it avoids issues with injections. I also learned how routes.rb tells rails where to go with each form change when implementing my search functions
