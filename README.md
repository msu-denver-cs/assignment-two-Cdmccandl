Assignment 2:
added validations to each model. assumed that length for each should be less than 2
and value presence should be true.

added search bars to each view by creating a search function in each controller
and calling this seach function in the view index for each model.

form changes:
added drop down form for car creation that references makes
added check box selection form for car creation that references Parts

What I learned:
How rails built in testing features work. I thought it was interesting and useful that rails allows you to directly validate in the model as it avoids issues with injections. I also learned how routes.rb tells rails where to go with each form change when implementing my search functions
